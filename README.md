Maze Pathfinding Algorithms Analysis

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Modern applications require pathfinding solutions that adapt to:
Dynamic environments (via procedural generation)
Scalability constraints (through variable maze sizes)
Performance demands (measured via time-space complexity)

. KEY FEATURES
- Maze Generation & Customization Using Prim’s Algorithm
    Adjustable size (e.g., 10x10 to 50x50).
    Complexity control (0.1–0.7) for wall density.
    Start/end point randomization.
- Pathfinding Algorithms
    BFS: Guarantees shortest path, high space complexity.
    DFS: Fast but suboptimal, low space usage.
    A*: Balanced (heuristic-driven).
- Visualization & Themes
    Modern Theme: Clean, color-coded grids (green/red for start/end).
    Vintage Theme: Retro aesthetics with grid lines and classic icons.
    Animations: Real-time path tracing with character icons.
- Performance Analysis
    Time Complexity: Execution time per algorithm.
    Space Complexity: Nodes visited.
    Path Optimality: Length vs. theoretical minimum.
- Comparative Tools
    Side-by-side maze comparisons (complexity 0.1–0.7).
    Interactive filtering (size/complexity/distance).
- Reporting & Export
    CSV export for benchmarking.
    Summary reports (report.txt) with metrics.
    Performance plots (time/space/path length).
- User Experience
    Interactive CLI for maze/theme selection.
    Error handling for invalid inputs.
