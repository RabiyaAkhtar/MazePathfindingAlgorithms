Maze Pathfinding Analysis

Project Overview:
A comparative analysis of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms for maze solving, featuring:
- **Maze Generation**: Prim's algorithm with adjustable complexity (0.1â€“0.7).
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: BFS (optimal), DFS (fast), A* (balanced).
- **Visualization**: 
  - **Themes**: Modern (clean) and vintage (retro) styles.
  - **Animations**: Real-time pathfinding with icons (dwarf/explorer).
  - **Performance Metrics**: Time, space (visited nodes), and path optimality.
  - **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side complexity comparisons.
